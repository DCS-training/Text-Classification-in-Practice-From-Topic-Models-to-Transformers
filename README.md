# Text Classification in Practice: From Topic Models to Transformers

Welcome to the Readme file for the CDCS Course '**Text Classification in Practice: From Topic Models to Transformers**'. Below you can find all the details that you will need to get ready and attend this class.

## Overview

Text classification is a core task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), underpinning many real-world applications such as spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and risk prediction.  

This course introduces participants to multiple paradigms of text classification, from traditional topic models to advanced transformer-based approaches. The 4-hour course will be delivered in two 2-hour sessions, combining lectures and hands-on implementation with real-world cases. Participants will build and evaluate classification pipelines with Python using Google Colab, explore feature-based models, sequential modelling, and deep learning with transformers. 

This course is ideal for those seeking to deepen their understanding of NLP workflows and apply them in research or applied contexts.
